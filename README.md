Designing Software:
When designing software, I start by clarifying the project’s requirements and goals. I focus on creating a plan that outlines functionality, user experience, and technical structure. Breaking the design into smaller tasks allows me to stay organized and ensures I address each feature with attention to detail.

New Design Skills from Project Work:
Working on this project enhanced my skills in 3D modeling and object transformation. I’ve learned to approach design with an eye for optimizing performance while maintaining a visually engaging interface. Experimenting with layering, perspective, and object scaling has refined my ability to create dynamic 3D scenes.

Design Process for Project Work:
My design process began with sketching out the desired 3D scene and identifying key components. I prioritized functionality, then focused on refining details like color schemes, shading, and object placement.

Applying Design Tactics in Future Work:
The systematic design approach I used, which involved planning, prototyping, and refining, is applicable to future projects. This process enables me to be more adaptive and intentional in improving user experiences.

Developing Programs:
In developing programs, I emphasize breaking down complex tasks into smaller, manageable coding tasks. This approach keeps the development organized and allows me to focus on testing each piece.

New Development Strategies in 3D Scene:
I employed iterative testing while working on my 3D scene. Experimenting with different transformations, perspectives, and shaders helped ensure the final result was as intended.

Role of Iteration in Development:
Iteration allowed me to refine the scene’s details progressively. Each iteration offered insights on what needed improvement, from rendering accuracy to object scaling.

Evolution of Development Approach through Milestones:
With each milestone, my coding approach evolved to become more structured and efficient. I became better at planning, anticipating potential issues, and organizing code logically for a more polished final product.

Computer Science in Reaching Goals:
Computer science provides a strong foundation for understanding and building technology. Skills in problem-solving and programming help me apply logical approaches to a wide range of technical challenges, essential for my career aspirations.

Knowledge and Skills from Computational Graphics in Education:
Learning computational graphics has enriched my understanding of mathematics and visual design. This knowledge applies to courses involving data visualization, simulations, and advanced programming.

Professional Knowledge and Skills from Computational Graphics:
In a professional setting, computational graphics can be valuable for creating visually compelling data representations and enhancing user interfaces. The skills I gained in rendering and design will be useful in fields that require strong visualization and analytical abilities.
